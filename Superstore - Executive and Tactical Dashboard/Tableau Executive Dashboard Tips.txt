EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD

Executive Dashboard = Used by Leaders
Simple type of dashboard from a layout and content perspective

The goal is typically to convey a few key metrics with just enough 
detail to provide a story but not enough to drown the viewer.

Exploratory interactivity is not usually necessary

They don't have the time to do their own digging but a limited 
amount of control can make it very engaging.

Another point to consider is the frequency with which the dashboard will be viewed.

The higher level executives will likely be more interested with longer term trends 
and periodic updates

leaving the execution in day to day management in their team's hands.
This means that they'll probably not be viewing the dashboard very frequently which 
in turn means we should make the interface as simple and self-explanatory as possible.

We want our audience to get it without having to first read instructions or learn an interface.

If they access the dashboard say monthly they'll have forgotten the instructions from last time and
will have to relearn.

STRATEGIC DASHBOARD

Waterfall Charts

Waterfall charts are useful for showing how parts contrubute to a whole when there are negative values
Create a waterfall chart using Gantt chart type and a negative calculated field as the size

Show a dynamic reference line by using a parameter or calculation on a parameter

Heat Maps

Heat maps quickly highlight patterns and outliers over multiple fields or dimensions

Build a heat map by dragging your discrete dimensions (For example, categoriy and Region) 
to the rows and columns shelves. Then drag your measure, like profit, to color and size
